FOSHttpCacheBundle
==================

This is a work in progress to unite the FOSHttpCacheBundle and
DriebitHttpCacheBundle into one good bundle. We
[hope to publish this as a FOS bundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/friendsofsymfony.github.com/issues/42)

Introduction

global configuration options to set caching headers based on the path,
controller and other aspects of the request. It provides means to actively
invalidate caching proxies and some additional tools that can help when working
with a caching proxy.
